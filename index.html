							<h2>Web &amp; App developer</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A little something about me, eh?<br> My name is <em>Reed</em>. I was born in Vancouver, WA but didn't stay there long. I have moved around my entire life to the point where the entire Northwest feels like home. During my time at college I acquired an <em>Associates Degree in Applied Science and Arts</em>. Immediately after, I started my professional life out as a young <em>Firefighter EMT</em> working with one of the busiest fire departments in the state of WA. After four years of hard work, and a disturbing amount of training, I received several musculoskeletal injuries in a freak car accident(pretty lame, hu!). <br /><strong>This is where coding comes in.</strong> <br /><br />Back in July 2015 I wrote my first line of code in Seattle. While recovering from my injuries in early fall, I found solace in continuing to learn how to code and never stopped. <br> I am hoping that my career as a developer gives me the resources as well as the freedom to continue to reach my goals and travel the world.</p></p>

					<h2>SKILLz</h2>
					<p>I studied front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, UI/UX)on my own before attending code school full-time. After attending code school, I have experience and exposure to many different technology languages. My Github is full of projects written in Java as well as common frameworks like Ember, Angular and Android Studio. <br />
						My mission is to never stop learning and to get my hands on as many technology languages and frameworks as I can in hopes of persistently being a better developer than I was yesterday.</p>
