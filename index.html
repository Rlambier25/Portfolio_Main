											<h2>Web &amp; App developer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>A little something about me, eh?<br> My name is <em>Reed</em>. I was born in Vancouver, WA but didn't stay there long. I have moved around my entire life all over to the point where the entire Northwest feels like home. I have an <em>Associates Degree in Applied Science and Arts</em>. I <strong>LOVE</strong> to travel and explore the world. I started my professsional life out as a young <em>Firefighter EMT</em> working with one of the busiest fire departments in the state of WA. After four years of hard work, and a disturbing amount of training, I recieved several musculoskeletal injuries in a freak car accident. This is where coding comes in. Back in July 2015 I wrote my first line of code in Seattle. While recovering from my injuries in early fall, I found solice in continuing to learn how to code. <br> I am hoping that my career as a software engineer gives me the resources as well as the freedom to live my life the way I have always wanted.</p></p>

									<h2>SKILLZ</h2>
									<p>I studied front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, UI/UX)on my own before attending code school fulltime. I have experience and exposure to many different technology languages after attending code school. My Github is full of projects written in Java as well as common frameworks like Ember, Angular and Android Studio. <br />
									My mission is to never stop learning and to get my hands on as many technology languages and frameworks as I can in hopes of persistantly being a better developer than I was yesterday.</p>
